Strings are collections of characters that are used to show blocks of text in
JavaScript.
Special values can be escaped by placing a backslash ( \ ) in front of them.
Strings have various properties and methods that provide information
about them.
The length property tells us how many characters there are in a string.
Strings can be concatenated (joined together) using the + operator
