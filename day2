Strings are collections of characters that are used to show blocks of text in
JavaScript.
Special values can be escaped by placing a backslash ( \ ) in front of them.
Strings have various properties and methods that provide information
about them.
The length property tells us how many characters there are in a string.
Strings can be concatenated (joined together) using the + operator

Numbers can be integers such as 2 or floats (decimals) such as 7.8,
although JavaScript doesn’t differentiate between them and just has a
single primitive data type of Number .
Numbers can be written in exponential notation such as 5e6 for five
million.
The arithmetic operations +, -, *, / and % can be applied to any two
numbers.
It’s possible to change strings to numbers and vice versa.
If you try to perform operations between a string and a number, JavaScript
will attempt to convert the type to complete the operation. This can cause
some inconsistent and unexpected results!
A random number between 0 and 1 is returned by the Math.random()
method.
