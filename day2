Strings are collections of characters that are used to show blocks of text in
JavaScript.
Special values can be escaped by placing a backslash ( \ ) in front of them.
Strings have various properties and methods that provide information
about them.
The length property tells us how many characters there are in a string.
Strings can be concatenated (joined together) using the + operator

Numbers can be integers such as 2 or floats (decimals) such as 7.8,
although JavaScript doesn’t differentiate between them and just has a
single primitive data type of Number .
Numbers can be written in exponential notation such as 5e6 for five
million.
The arithmetic operations +, -, *, / and % can be applied to any two
numbers.
It’s possible to change strings to numbers and vice versa.
If you try to perform operations between a string and a number, JavaScript
will attempt to convert the type to complete the operation. This can cause
some inconsistent and unexpected results!
A random number between 0 and 1 is returned by the Math.random()
method.

Arrays are an ordered list of values.
An array literal is written using square brackets containing commaseparated values—such as [2,3,5,7] .
Arrays can contain any type of value—even other arrays!
The index is used to reference a specific item in an array. For example,
myArray[0] refers to the first item in myArray .
Multi-dimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays.
Arrays have many methods that can be used to add, remove and
manipulate items in the array.
The spread operator is used by placing an ellipsis of three dots in front of
an array. It has the effect of taking all the values out of the array and listing
them as separate values inside a new array
