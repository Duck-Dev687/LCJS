A loop is a block of code that runs over and over again until a certain
condition is met.
An infinite loop is a loop that never stops, as it’s impossible to meet the
condition for breaking out of the loop.
A while loop will continue to run as long as a particular condition is true.
A do–while loop will also run while a condition is true, but the condition
comes at the end, rather than the beginning of the loop.
A for loop sets the initial value, a condition for stopping, and increment at
the start, and then runs a block of code until the condition is met. After
every loop, the increment instruction is carried out.
Nested loops can be formed by running a loop within another loop. The
inner loop runs all the way through for every pass of the outer loop.

  Functions can be defined using the function declaration, or by creating a
function expression by assigning an anonymous function to a variable.
Arrow functions are a shorthand notation that can used for writing short,
one-line, anonymous functions.
All functions return a value. If this isn’t explicitly stated, the function will
return undefined .
A parameter is a value that’s written in the parentheses of a function
declaration and can be used like a variable inside the function’s body.
An argument is a value that’s provided to a function when it’s called.
The return value of a function can be assigned to a variable.
A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to a
