Events occur when a user interacts with a web page.
An event listener is attached to an element and then invokes a callback
function when the event occurs.
The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and
contains a number of properties and methods relating to the event.
There are many types of events, including click events, mouse events and
keyboard events.
Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form
before it has been submitted.
You can remove an event using the removeEventListener() method.
The default behavior of elements can be prevented using the
preventDefault() function.
Event delegation is when an event listener is added to a parent element to
capture events that happen to multiple child elements in order to avoid
adding an event listener for every single child element.
